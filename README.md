## Install

### Requirements
- A **Galaxy Watch4 or newer** (Wear OS Powered by Samsung / One UI Watch)
- An **Android phone** (Android 8.0 or newer) paired with the watch
- Heartline on **both** devices

Watches and phones Heartline has been tested on: [Tested devices](docs/TESTED_DEVICES.md).

### From GitHub Releases
1. Download `Heartline-phone-<version>.apk` and `Heartline-watch-<version>.apk` from the
   [latest release](https://github.com/selin2005/heartline/releases/latest).
2. Install the phone app on the phone and the watch app on the watch with `adb`.
   Step by step: [Installing on a device](docs/DEVICE_TESTING.md).
3. Until Heartline is approved as a Samsung Health partner, turn on **developer mode** in the
   watch's **Health Platform** app (called Health Sensor Service on older watches). The phone app
   shows how.

A **Google Play** release is being prepared (see [docs/PLAY_STORE.md](docs/PLAY_STORE.md)).

### Updates and beta versions
The phone app checks for new releases once a day and installs them after checking their
SHA-256 checksum: **Settings → Updates**.
- Which versions you're offered depends on your **update channel**, which starts at the kind of
  build you installed:

  | Channel | You get |
  |---|---|
  | **Stable** | main releases |
  | **Beta** | betas and the main releases after them |
  | **Development** | every new build: development builds, betas and main releases |

  Updating from a development build to a beta or main release keeps you on the development
  channel (and from a beta to a main release on the beta channel). Beta and development builds
  can change it in **Settings → Updates → Update channel**. To join the beta from a main release,
  install a beta from [Releases](https://github.com/selin2005/heartline/releases) over it.
- After each update, **What's new** shows the release notes.
- When the watch app is behind, the phone tells you and links to the watch APK.

All changes are listed in the [changelog](CHANGELOG.md).

## Privacy
There is no account, no server, no analytics and no ads. Health data never leaves your devices
unless you export or share it. The only network request the app makes is the update check to
GitHub. Read the [Privacy Policy](legal/PRIVACY_POLICY.md) and the [Terms of Use](legal/TERMS_OF_USE.md).
The app asks you to accept both on first launch.

## Build from source

```bash
./gradlew :phone:assembleDebug :wear:assembleDebug   # debug APKs
./gradlew test verifyPaparazziDebug                  # JVM, Robolectric and screenshot tests
./gradlew ktlintCheck                                 # lint
./gradlew -Pheartline.fakeSensors=true :wear:assembleDebug   # watch app with simulated sensors
```

Requirements: JDK 21 and the Android SDK (compile SDK 37).

| Module | Contents |
|---|---|
| `shared/` | Kotlin/JVM: models, sync protocol, and the ECG, HRV, rhythm, blood pressure and stress algorithms, with JVM tests |
| `datalayer/` | Android library: the sync transport over the Wearable Data Layer |
| `phone/` | Phone app (Jetpack Compose, Material 3, Room, Koin, Glance widgets) |
| `wear/` | Watch app (Wear Compose, Samsung Health Sensor SDK, tiles and complications) |
| `tools/` | Model training and evaluation, screenshot and release scripts |

Documentation: [docs/](docs/README.md). This covers the [ECG](docs/algorithms/ECG_ALGORITHM.md)
and [blood pressure](docs/algorithms/BP_ALGORITHM.md) algorithms, the
[sync protocol](docs/architecture/PROTOCOL.md), the [design system](docs/DESIGN.md) and
[releasing](docs/RELEASING.md).

Bugs and device reports go to [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/selin2005/heartline/issues/new/choose),
so they can be tracked. Heartline doesn't give medical advice there either: for health questions,
talk to a doctor.
