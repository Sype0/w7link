# Blood pressure on the watch: change history (algorithms 3 to 6.4)

This file is the history of the blood-pressure algorithm: what each version changed, why, and
what the real data showed at the time. Older sections describe behaviour that has since been
replaced (for example the forearm ρgh correction, removed in 6.4, and the feature list of
PpgFeatures v3, now v5). **The current algorithm is specified completely in
[BP_ALGORITHM.md](BP_ALGORITHM.md)**; when the two differ, that file and the code are right.

Heartline estimates blood pressure (BP) from the watch's green PPG pulse wave. It uses the same
approach as Samsung Health Monitor: calibrated pulse-wave analysis (PWA).

## Algorithm 6.5: five corrections found by writing the full specification

Writing the complete specification ([BP_ALGORITHM.md](BP_ALGORITHM.md)) line by line from the code
found five places where the code didn't do what it meant to:

1. **Transit noise:** `TransitEstimator` added the rounds' misfit $r$ and the slope × round spread,
   which is the same misfit expressed in ms ($b(\Delta x - \Delta S/b) = -(\Delta S - b\Delta x)$), so
   it counted twice. Now only the spread term (with its 5 ms floor) is used.
2. **Coupled diastolic baseline:** anchored along $\rho \times$ the systolic slopes, which its change
   uses, instead of the 6.3 shape model's diastolic slopes.
3. **Wide ±:** above ±12 mmHg (`RANGE_ONLY_SD`, defined but unused since algorithm 6) the reading
   keeps its number and ± but is shown without a category, on the watch and the phone.
4. **Direction of a change** (`deltaSystolic`, used to confirm a reading with a second one) is
   measured from the model's own time-weighted, anchored reference, not the plain mean of the cuff
   readings.
5. **Phone correction** is rounded, not truncated.

Measured with `bpEval` on the 9 cuff checks: the shown numbers are the same as 6.4 (systolic
+1.7 / 4.0 / 3.2, diastolic −2.9 / 7.7 / 6.0 ONLINE; +0.1 / 3.7 / 2.6 and −1.3 / 8.6 / 6.9
leave-one-out). Unrounded, the systolic moved by at most 0.4 mmHg and the diastolic by at most
0.16; the BCG channel's ± fell by 0.1–1.2 mmHg. These are corrections, not tuning.

## What changed in algorithm 3 (and why)

Algorithm 2 refused to show a number ("Outside your calibration") whenever today's pulse wave or
estimate was far from the calibration. That hid exactly the readings that matter: a pressure
that has really gone up or down. It also fired on noise, because a single noisy shape feature
(APG d/a, area ratio) crossing its limit was enough. Research on calibrated cuffless devices
shows the real failure is the opposite of refusing: readings are pulled towards the calibration
(Galaxy Watch Active2: proportional bias slope ≈ 0.56, SD 15.5 mmHg; Falter et al. 2022), and
changes need re-calibration at the change point (Tae et al. 2026). Algorithm 3:

1. **Never hides a real change.** A reading beyond the calibration is shown, with a wider ±,
   flagged "beyond your calibration range", and the user is asked to measure again. A second
   reading within 10 minutes that points the same way marks it **confirmed**.
2. **Safety wording.** ≥ 180 and/or ≥ 120 (very high) or < 90/60 (low) adds a check-with-a-cuff
   message and, when confirmed, a phone notification. Wellness wording, never a diagnosis.
3. **Refuses only bad signal.** A shape no real pulse has (upstroke longer than 60 % of the beat,
   pulse width longer than the beat, heart rate outside 30–200) or a marginal recording (quality
   < 0.7) whose core shape is also far off → "Unsteady signal, try again". Arm movement measured
   by the accelerometer (> 0.6 m/s² SD) → "Keep your arm still". Noisy shape features that jump
   on their own are simply ignored for that reading.
4. **Learns from cuff checks.** Every "compare with cuff" becomes a calibration point (up to 12).
   The calibration then spans a real pressure range, and its baseline follows the user's drift.
5. **Detects drift.** Three readings in a row beyond the calibration in the same direction ask
   for a cuff check; cuff checks that keep disagreeing the same way (CUSUM) ask to recalibrate.
6. **Learns each user's normal spread** of the features from their recent in-range readings.
7. **New feature:** the reflected-wave delay (systolic peak → diastolic peak/inflection, the
   stiffness-index timing; Millasseau 2002), which shortens as pressure rises.

Algorithm 4 is the phone's personal learned model, described below.

## Algorithm 6.4: measured on real cuff checks, the forearm angle no longer moves the number

A user with treated hypertension (Galaxy Watch6 Classic) sent a complete export: a calibration,
9 readings each checked with a cuff, and one reading taken lying in bed that came out far too
low (111/39, while the cuff the same afternoon said 142/87). `./gradlew :shared:bpEval
-Pdir=<unpacked export>` replays every cuff-checked session through the algorithm
(`BpExportEvaluation`; it reproduced the numbers the watch had shown exactly).

**What was wrong:**

1. **The forearm angle was taken as the hand's height.**
   - The wrist's ρgh (0.78 mmHg/cm × 0.33 × height × sin of the forearm angle) was taken off
     every channel.
   - Lying in bed the forearm pointed 58° down, so 37 mmHg came off, though the wrist was nowhere
     near 47 cm below the heart. At +15° and −18° it gave +15 and −17 mmHg errors.
   - The model is calibrated to a cuff on the upper arm at heart level, which the hand's height
     doesn't change.

   | Reading | Forearm | Taken off | Shown | Cuff | Error (6.3) | Error (6.4) |
   |---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
   | 1 Oct 02:30 | +15° | −13 | 152/92 | 137/86 | +15/+6 | +2/−8 |
   | 1 Oct 03:18 | −18° | +13 | 129/62 | 146/99 | −17/−37 | −6/−19 |
   | 2 Oct 14:25, lying | −58° | +37 | 111/39 | (≈142/87 sitting) | | 142/84 ±11, flagged |

2. **The diastolic had its own shape model with population slopes.** For this user, a wider,
   flatter wave meant a lower diastolic by 11–13 mmHg while the cuff's went up. Its ± was
   0.7 × the systolic's (±4) while it missed by ±10.

3. **The phone's personal correction (`HybridBpModel`) switched on after 6 checks**, trained on
   numbers that carried the angle error, and made one reading worse.

**What changed** (`BpTuning`, all variants measurable with `bpEval`):

- **Forearm angle:** no ρgh is taken off any more (`hydrostaticFactor = 0`, also for the transit
  channel, where the geometry from the forearm angle was as unreliable). A posture far from the
  calibration's (forearm > 30° off, or the watch > 45° from every calibration round) is flagged
  instead: the ± grows by 8 mmHg, the reading is marked beyond calibration, and the watch says to
  sit with the forearm resting at heart level.
- **Diastolic:** it now follows the systolic change times this user's own diastolic/systolic
  ratio, learned from the cuff readings around 0.5 (`Diastolic.COUPLED`). Its ± comes from its
  own misfit on the cuff readings.
- **Phone correction:** only from 12 checks, when it beats the classical estimate by at least
  1.5 mmHg and on the diastolic too. It is trained on the classical numbers recomputed by
  replaying each reading's session.
- **Crash:** a motion recorder left running made the watch run out of memory after hours. It
  now stops itself after 40 000 samples, and a screen that goes away stops it.

**Result on the 9 cuff checks** (calibration as it was before each reading):

| | Systolic mean / SD / MAE | Diastolic mean / SD / MAE |
|---|---|---|
| 6.3 | +1.8 / 9.0 / 6.9 | −4.9 / 14.3 / 9.1 |
| 6.4 | +1.7 / 4.0 / 3.2 | −2.9 / 7.7 / 6.0 |
| 6.4, leave-one-out | +0.1 / 3.7 / 2.6 | −1.3 / 8.6 / 6.9 |

Nine readings from one person in a narrow range (133–146) are not a validation study. Each new
export with cuff checks goes through `bpEval` before a tuning changes. `BpRealLog2Test` keeps
this user's derived numbers (features, forearm angle, cuff; no raw waves, nothing identifying)
as a regression test.

## Algorithm 6.3: follow the pressure away from the calibration, with an honest ±

The second user's first reading after a new calibration was 141/80 ±3; the cuff said 137/76. The
calibration's cuff average was about 139/79, and all three channels (green and infrared pulse
wave, wrist BCG) agreed on "no change". Two things were wrong:

1. **The ± was too narrow.**
   - Three channels combined by inverse variance give ±3, as if their errors were independent.
   - But they are all anchored to the same cuff calibration, so the reference's error and the
     pressure's own beat-to-beat variation are shared.
   - Now the fused ± is never below 5 mmHg systolic and 3.5 diastolic (`BpFusion.COMMON_SD`).
2. **The fusion leaned towards "no change".**
   - A channel's ± included its uncertainty about the size of a change: slope uncertainty times
     the change it sees. So a channel that saw a fall (the transit time) got a wide ± and almost
     no weight, while channels that saw nothing kept their narrow ±.
   - Calibrated at 139/79 (`BpAlgorithm63Test`), a synthetic fall to 90/60 read about 140. So did a
     rise to 170/100.
   - Now:
     - **Weights:** each channel's weight comes from its measurement noise only.
       - The transit channel's noise is the scatter of this watch's own calibration rounds,
         through the slope. On the real Watch6 the rounds scattered by about 30 ms, which keeps
         that channel from leading.
       - The scale uncertainty is added back into the ± (`ChannelEstimate.scaleSys`).
     - **Disagreement:** channels that disagree more than their noise allows (reduced
       chi-square > 4) widen the ± and flag the reading as beyond calibration (compare with a
       cuff), instead of being averaged into a confident number.
     - The 6.2 rule that dropped a disagreeing channel is gone: that channel may be the one that
       sees a real change.
   - On the same test, the fall reads 133 (±19, flagged), or 115 (±23, flagged) with constricted
     wrist vessels, and the rise reads 144.

**What still limits the watch:**
- The rise is followed only part of the way because the slope for this user is still uncertain.
- The synthetic pulse-wave shape is not a physiological model of pressure, so these tests check
  the fusion, not the pulse-wave sensitivity.
- Cuff checks at other pressures (another time of day, after medication, standing) teach the
  model this user's own slopes. Only real sessions with cuff values can tune the rest.

**Logs:**
- **Phone:** the cuff values of every calibration round and every cuff check, and the saved
  calibration.
- **Watch:** each session's notes and events (state, window, calibration cuff values, why a
  calibration can't be used) next to its numbers, and `fusion.chi2`.

## Algorithm 6.2: one wave polarity per calibration

A second user (Galaxy Watch6 Classic, treated hypertension) had two problems:

- **Reading too low:** with the cuff at 140/80, the watch said 110/53.
- **No reading at all:** later measurements kept ending in "calibrate again" and never showed a
  number.

A calibration without a standing round then read 135/83 against a cuff of about 135–140/80–85.
The diagnostic log only started after the first problems, so those sessions were not logged.

What the code showed:

1. **The wave's polarity is not stable on the Watch6.**
   - The Watch6's raw green PPG has no large light-intensity offset (its level sits around zero and
     jumps in steps). So which way up the pulse is was decided by a slope heuristic in every
     recording, and the heuristic can flip.
   - A pulse read upside down has a completely different shape: rise and width swap, and the area
     ratio collapses. In `BpAlgorithm62Test`, a calibration at 140/80 read the same pulse, upside
     down, as about 116/66.
   - Fixes:
     - The calibration fixes the polarity: the majority of its seated rounds (`BpCalibration.polarity`).
     - Every measurement is read that way up (`PpgFeatures.extract(…, polarity)`, `BpWindowSelector.best`).
     - A round read the other way is read again from its stored raw wave (`BpCalibration.aligned`),
       instead of being dropped. Dropping it left 2 rounds, so the watch asked for a new calibration
       while the phone still called the calibration valid.
   - `isValid` now counts exactly the rounds the estimator can use, so the phone and the watch agree.
2. **A left-over calibration request turned measurements into calibration rounds.**
   - The watch kept the phone's round request until a round succeeded. After a round that had to be
     taken again, every later "measure" recorded a calibration round.
   - Now only the calibration screen the phone opens records rounds. A request expires after
     15 minutes, and a new calibration ends it.
3. **Transit channels are more robust.**
   - The wrist-BCG transit time only counts between 80 and 300 ms. The Watch6 gave 440 and 396 ms
     next to 132 ms.
   - Calibration rounds far from the others (> 60 ms) and the standing round are left out of the
     transit fit: the hanging hand changes the transit time, not the cuff's pressure.
   - (6.2 also dropped a channel that contradicted the others; 6.3 replaced that, see below.)

The log now shows why:

- **Session log:**
  - `polarity.calibration.*` and `polarity.detected.green`;
  - `calibration.cuff`;
  - `needsCalibration` (round by round);
  - `fusion.excluded.*`.
- **Watch log:**
  - "BP start: measure / calibration round N";
  - why a round is taken again.

## Algorithm 6.1: lessons from the first real session logs

The first logs from a real watch (Galaxy Watch8 Classic) looked like this:

- **Calibration:** 4 rounds, calibrated in precise (ECG) mode.
- **Readings:** two quick readings, 112/71 ±12 and 108/65 ±17. Both were higher than expected,
  with a wide ±.

The sensors worked:

- PPG came in green, IR and red.
- The accelerometer ran at about 100 Hz.
- The BCG quality was 0.61–0.68.

Yet only green pulse-wave analysis was used, because of these bugs:

1. **The PPG inside ECG_ON_DEMAND is not a 500 Hz wave.**
   - Only every 5th sample carries a value; the rest are −1.
   - The level jumps by hundreds of thousands of counts when the sensor switches gain.
   - Everything computed from it (shape features, PAT) was meaningless.
   - Fix: `PpgRepair` turns −1 into gaps, interpolates them and cancels gain jumps. PAT and
     precise mode now use the repaired signal.
2. **A calibration from one PPG source was compared with readings from another.**
   - Precise rounds (ECG-channel PPG) were used to calibrate quick readings (PPG_ON_DEMAND).
     The waves differ systematically: upstroke 231–260 ms vs 167–215 ms, width 452–594 ms vs
     262–442 ms. The model read that difference as a stiffer, higher-pressure wave (+14 mmHg,
     "beyond calibration").
   - Fix: every calibration point records its PPG source (`ppgFs`), and a channel only fits on
     rounds of the same source.
   - A calibration is valid only with 3 quick seated rounds.
   - Calibration is always quick mode now: no ECG unasked. IR and BCG get cuff points too.
   - Precise mode is only offered once precise rounds exist; it stays experimental.
3. **Breathing-related sinus arrhythmia was read as atrial fibrillation.**
   - The recording had interval CV 0.16 and RMSSD 73 ms at 74 bpm (a smooth, patterned
     variation), which the plain CV > 0.15 rule called irregular.
   - Fix: blood pressure now uses the app's own irregular-rhythm rule (`RrFeatures`: nRMSSD,
     entropy and turning points, the same rule as the background notification) on the PPG beats.
   - Premature beats are judged against the local rhythm.
   - The app's ECG AI is used as a prior. No ECG is recorded for blood pressure; the latest ECG
     result of the last 30 days is read instead:
     - atrial fibrillation there turns on the AF handling;
     - sinus rhythm there asks for stronger evidence.
4. **A standing round at 106 bpm was detected upside down** and entered the shape fit. Fixes:
   - Standing rounds are left out of the shape fit.
   - Rounds whose polarity disagrees with the majority are left out too.
   - Raw light intensity is assumed upside down unless clearly upright.
5. **Unsteady calibration rounds** (a pulse rising 1.5 bpm/s, the amplitude changing 42 %) became
   the reference.
   - Fix: a round needs a steady window (|pulse trend| ≤ 0.5 bpm/s, |amplitude trend| ≤ 35 %),
     quality ≥ 0.7 and ≥ 15 beats, or the watch asks to take it again.

These are covered by `BpRealLogTest`, built on the logged numbers. Each channel's ± is now logged
by component (base, residual, drift, extrapolation, doubt).

## Algorithm 6: every sensor, one fused number

Algorithm 5 refused to give a number in an unsteady state, and in the compensating state it
showed a "possible low pressure" message. Users rejected both: a person whose pressure drops feels
it, and the point of the app is to show the most accurate number the watch can measure.
Algorithm 6 therefore never refuses for the body's state. Instead it measures with **every
sensor the watch has**. Each sensor gives an independent estimate, and they are fused with weights
set by the body's state.

### Channels

| Channel | Sensor | What it measures | Why it helps |
|---|---|---|---|
| `PWA_GREEN` | green PPG | pulse shape (algorithms 3–5) | baseline tracking at rest |
| `PWA_IR` | infrared PPG (SDK `PpgType.IR`) | the same, deeper tissue | less affected by skin vasoconstriction |
| `BCG_PTT` | accelerometer (fastest rate) + PPG | wrist ballistocardiogram I wave → PPG foot (Yousefian & Mukkamala 2019) | transit time **without** the pre-ejection period, which stress halves |
| `PAT` | ECG + its PPG (precise mode) | R peak → PPG foot | classic PAT; unreliable under stress (kept, down-weighted) |
| `ECG_PTT` | ECG + accelerometer + PPG | PAT − PEP, with PEP = R → BCG I wave | the true arterial transit time |
| `HYDRO_MAP` | PPG + accelerometer, arm-raise maneuver | mean pressure where the PPG amplitude peaks (Shaltis & Asada 2008) | cuff-free absolute pressure; only reachable when the mean pressure is very low |

- **Timing marker.** Transit times use the PPG pulse's **intersecting-tangent foot**. The
  steepest upstroke moves with the ejection time, so a fast pulse would otherwise read as a
  shorter transit time.
- **Transit estimator.** Each transit channel is calibrated like pulse-wave analysis (Bayesian,
  population prior of −0.8 mmHg/ms for PTT and −0.5 for PAT with a ±50 % prior, recent cuff points
  weighted more; `TransitEstimator`).
- **Arm-raise slope.** The maneuver measures the PAT slope **in the session** from the known
  hydrostatic pressure change (0.78 mmHg/cm; McCombie 2007). The slope then reflects the body's
  state now instead of the calibration day.

### Other sensors

- **Arm height.** The rotation vector and gravity give the forearm angle. The wrist pressure
  differs from the calibration's by ρgh (arm length 0.33 × height from the profile). This
  difference is removed from the pulse-wave channels in full, and from the transit channels for
  the arm's share of the path (50 %).
- **Skin temperature** (Watch5+) and **skin conductance** (EDA, Watch8+) are read just before the
  recording.
  - A cold wrist widens the pulse-wave ±.
  - A conductance surge marks a sympathetic response when the perfusion index is missing.

### State-weighted fusion (`BpFusion`)

- **Combination.** The channels are combined by inverse variance, after each channel's ± is
  multiplied by a factor for the body's state. For example, in a compensating state green PWA gets
  × 2.5 and IR PWA × 1.8, while the BCG and ECG transit times get only × 1.2.
- **Disagreement.** When channels disagree more than their ± allow, the fused ± grows by the
  Birge ratio.
- **Compensating state, PWA channels.** Only 30 % of the shape change is trusted (the rest is
  vasoconstriction and goes into the ±), and the pulse-rate term is off, because the fast pulse
  is the compensation itself.

### Recording

- **Quick mode** (no touch):
  - skin temperature and conductance first (about 10 s);
  - then green, IR and red PPG with the motion sensors, for at least 20 s and until the pulse is
    steady (at most 60 s; 45 s of beats for an irregular rhythm);
  - `BpWindowSelector` picks the steadiest 20 s window.
- **Precise mode** (finger on the lower key, 34 s): ECG, its PPG and the motion sensors, with a
  slow arm raise in the middle:

  | Seconds | Step |
  |---|---|
  | 0–12 | rest |
  | 12–18 | raise |
  | 18–20 | hold |
  | 20–26 | lower |
  | 26–34 | rest |

  Calibration rounds can be precise too (phone setting), so the ECG channels get cuff points.
- **Irregular rhythm.** Only beats whose own and preceding intervals are typical are averaged
  (pulse shape depends on the filling time before it). The ± is wider, but the reading is shown.

### Raw session logs (for developing the algorithm on real data)

Every session, including failed ones and calibration rounds, writes a `BpSessionLog` (gzip,
format in `BpSessionLog.kt`):

- every sample of every sensor with its timestamp (PPG points exactly as the SDK gives them, with
  statuses; ECG; accelerometer, gyroscope, rotation; skin temperature; EDA);
- the phase events;
- every intermediate value: features per channel, state, BCG, PAT, PEP, PTT, maneuver, each
  channel's estimate, fusion weights and the result.

The logs go to the phone with the readings. Share → **BP raw sessions (zip)** exports them with
the calibration and cuff checks, and `tools/bp-ml/read_session.py` reads them.
`BpSessionReplay.replay` runs the current pipeline on any logged session, so every change can be
measured on everything recorded so far.

### Honest limits of algorithm 6

- The channel priors, the state factors and the arm geometry come from the literature. They were
  checked on **synthetic** multi-sensor sessions (`SyntheticSession`, `BpAlgorithm6Test`),
  including the bathroom episode: true 92/60 at pulse 125→110 reads within 8 mmHg with the quick
  sensors, and green PPG alone never reads above 115.
- Whether a given watch delivers IR/red PPG, a fast enough accelerometer and aligned clocks is
  unknown until tested; see the device checklist (docs/DEVICE_TESTING.md, item 15). Each missing
  channel simply drops out of the fusion, which then shows a wider ±.
- The Shaltis mean pressure needs the amplitude to peak within reach of a raised arm (≈ 45 mmHg of
  hydrostatic drop). That happens only when the mean pressure is very low; otherwise the maneuver
  gives the slope and a lower bound.

## What changed in algorithm 5 (and why)

(Superseded by algorithm 6 above. Algorithm 5 refused to give a number, or showed a low-pressure
message, in unsteady states. Its state recognition, heart-rate decoupling, rhythm handling and
health profile remain.)

A user with a usual pressure of 104/70 felt dizzy and short of breath right after using the
toilet (a vasovagal / orthostatic drop). The watch showed **147/93 ±13, pulse 120, beyond
calibration**: the opposite of what was happening. The cause was in the model, not the sensor:

1. **The pulse rate drove the estimate.** The prior sensitivity was +0.45 mmHg per bpm, linear
   and unbounded. Pulse 120 against a calibration at about 70 added about 22 mmHg by itself. Within
   a person, the rate is a weak pressure signal. After standing up, in a vasovagal episode, with
   dehydration, anaemia, fever, blood loss, POTS or AF, the pulse races while pressure stays the
   same or falls.
2. **The rate was counted twice.** Ejection shortens as the rate rises (LVET ≈ 413 − 1.7·HR ms,
   Weissler 1968). Upstroke, pulse width and reflection delay therefore shorten with the rate
   alone, and the model read that as "stiffer, higher pressure".
3. **Sympathetic vasoconstriction at the wrist** narrows the wave even more, although central
   pressure is low. Its signature is a small pulse relative to the light level (low perfusion
   index), which was not measured.
4. **There was no notion of state.** A pulse still settling after standing, a pulse amplitude
   still recovering, and an irregular rhythm were all treated as a steady resting recording.

Algorithm 5 rests on one principle, which the ESH 2023 recommendations, ISO 81060-3 and the
2015–2025 cuffless reviews all point to: a calibrated cuffless reading is only valid in the
steady state it was calibrated in, so first decide whether the body is in that state.

| Step | What | Where |
|---|---|---|
| Rhythm gate | Premature beats (a short interval followed by a compensatory pause) are detected. Each premature beat, its pause and the stronger post-extrasystolic beat are left out of the ensemble. An irregular rhythm (interval CV > 0.15, ≥ 3 premature beats or > 40 % of beats rejected) gives **no number**, like validated cuffs do in AF. This applies only when the pulses themselves are clean (noise also gives irregular spacing). | `PpgFeatures.rhythm`, `HemodynamicStateClassifier` |
| State features (extractor v4) | Interval CV, premature-beat count, rejected share, pulse-rate trend (bpm/s), **perfusion index** (AC/DC of the raw light level) and the amplitude trend over the recording. | `PpgFeatureVector` v4 |
| State classifier | **COMPENSATORY**: pulse > 25 bpm above calibration **and** perfusion index < 0.6 × calibration (15 bpm and 0.75 with POTS). **TRANSIENT**: rate changing > 0.5 bpm/s, amplitude changing > 35 %, or the arm more than 35° from every calibration position (gravity vector from the accelerometer). None of these give a number. When a compensating pattern also shows a falling rate or a changing pulse, "a drop in pressure fits this pattern" advice is shown instead. | `HemodynamicState.kt` |
| Rate decoupling | Timing features are moved to 70 bpm (0.5, 1.2 and 0.9 ms/bpm for upstroke, width and reflection delay: below the LVET slope, because only part of each interval is ejection). The rate term is bounded with tanh at ±6 / ±4 mmHg. | `BpEstimator.corrected`, `HR_CAP_*` |
| Honest output | If the rate term is ≥ 4 mmHg and outweighs the shape change, the reading is *rate-dominated*: ± widens, it is flagged, it is shown as a **range without a category**, and it is never "very high". A reading with ± > 12 is also shown as a range. The ± also grows with a changed perfusion index, premature beats and AF. | `BpEstimate.rangeOnly`, `BpSafety` |
| Health profile | Stored with the calibration and editable on the phone. Beta blocker or pacemaker: the rate is left out of the fit and the estimate. POTS / orthostatic hypotension: the same, plus a more sensitive compensatory check. AF: a 45 s recording, no rhythm gate, wider ±. Pregnancy: "not validated, use a cuff". Diabetes, kidney disease or age ≥ 65: the calibration is valid for 14 days and the priors are wider. | `BpProfile` |
| Standing round | An optional 4th calibration reading while standing (watch arm at heart level). The fit then sees how this user's pulse and pressure respond to standing, which is where the rate misleads most. | `CalibrationViewModel`, `BpCalibration.STANDING_ROUND` |
| Evaluation | The replay report counts unsteady refusals separately, and gives the MAE of readings whose pulse was > 15 bpm above calibration. | `BpEvaluationReport` |

**Trade-off, stated plainly.** Without the rate term, the shape features alone move the estimate
less (the old model got much of its sensitivity from the rate). A genuine rise in pressure still
shows in the right direction, and it is tracked in full once cuff checks have taught the fit this
user's slopes (`BpAlgorithm5Test.aRealRiseInPressureIsStillShown`). A confident wrong number is
worse than an honest "measure again".

**Why not only a neural network?** For heart rate the signal labels itself (R–R intervals). For
pressure the label must come from a cuff, and public datasets (MIMIC, VitalDB, PulseDB) are
finger PPG from ICU and surgery. On other people and wrist PPG they fall to about 14/8.5 mmHg MAE,
and they contain almost no wrist vasovagal or orthostatic episodes. A network would learn the
same "fast pulse = high pressure" shortcut on exactly the out-of-distribution case above. So the
learned part stays personal and gated (algorithm 4). It is used only on steady, single-number
readings (never on range-only ones), and the v4 state features are now stored with every reading
so a wrist model can later be trained and replayed on real data.

## Why the first version kept giving the same numbers

The watch test showed the same reading every time. Three causes combined:

1. **Demo calibration.** Debug phone builds seeded a *synthetic* calibration and sent it to the
   watch. Real pulse waves were nowhere near its features, so every estimate hit the limit below.
2. **Hidden clamp.** Estimates were clamped to ±25/±15 mmHg around the calibration mean. When the
   features are far off, the clamp returns the same value every time.
3. **Upside-down PPG.** Raw Galaxy Watch green PPG is light intensity. It *falls* when blood
   volume rises, so the pulse is upside down. The extractor assumed upright pulses, so on real data
   it measured troughs as "systolic peaks".

Algorithm 2 fixes all three:
- the demo calibration is never seeded, and existing copies are purged on phone and watch;
- the clamp is removed;
- polarity is detected automatically.

## What is measured (PpgFeatures v3, 100 Hz PPG_ON_DEMAND green, 20 s)

1. Band-pass 0.5–8 Hz, zero phase.
2. **Polarity:** arterial pulses rise quickly and fall slowly. If the steepest slopes are negative,
   the signal is flipped.
3. Systolic peaks, then each pulse foot (the minimum in the 350 ms before the peak).
4. Beats of plausible length (0.33–1.6 s). Only beats within 20 % of the median length are kept, so
   an ectopic beat or a missed foot doesn't smear the average.
5. Each beat is normalised (foot 0, peak 1), stretched to the median length at 4× resolution, and
   combined into a **median ensemble beat**. This is far less noisy than per-beat values.
6. Features on the ensemble beat:

| Feature | Meaning | Literature |
|---|---|---|
| Heart rate | 60 / median beat length | HR–BP coupling |
| Upstroke time (ms) | foot → systolic peak | shorter with stiffer arteries and higher pressure (Elgendi 2012) |
| Width at 50 % / 25 % (ms) | pulse width | narrows as pressure rises (Awad 2007) |
| Area ratio | area after / before the systolic peak (beat detrended) | wave reflection, like the inflection point area (Wang 2009); noisy, so weighted lightly |
| APG b/a, d/a | second-derivative wave ratios, on the smoothed beat | vascular ageing and stiffness (Takazawa 1998); d/a is noisier on wrist PPG, so weighted lightly |
| Reflection delay (ms), v3 | systolic peak → diastolic peak, or the inflection where they merge | stiffness-index timing, shorter with stiffer arteries / higher pressure (Millasseau 2002) |
| Reflection index, RMSSD, skewness, 32-point beat shape, v3 | stored for the learned model and signal quality; not in the classical fit | Elgendi 2016 (skewness SQI) |

7. **Quality:** the median correlation of each beat with the ensemble beat, times the share of
   beats that correlate above 0.9. A reading needs quality ≥ 0.55 and at least 10 beats.

## Calibration (3 cuff readings, valid 28 days)

As in Samsung Health Monitor, the watch never measures without a valid calibration. The user
sits still and takes 3 upper-arm cuff readings on the phone. At the same time the watch records
20 s of PPG for each one; the phone opens the watch screen and each round starts by itself.

Each round stores:
- the features;
- the cuff values;
- the **raw PPG**, so the calibration can be re-analysed if the algorithm changes.

Calibrations made with algorithm 1 are no longer valid: the user is asked to calibrate again.
Algorithm 2 calibrations stay valid: the phone recomputes their features from the stored raw PPG
(`BpCalibration.upgraded`), and until then the estimator simply leaves out the v3 feature.

**Cuff checks (algorithm 3).** Blood pressure → Accuracy check → "Compare latest reading with a
cuff" stores the pair for the accuracy statistics *and* adds it to the calibration (features from
the reading's pulse wave, which the watch now sends with every reading). The phone re-sends the
calibration to the watch. At most 12 are kept, newest first.

## Estimate (BpEstimator)

`BP = reference cuff + w · (features − reference features)`

`w` is fitted per user with weighted Bayesian (ridge-to-prior) regression:

- **Prior:** population sensitivities, e.g. SBP +0.45 mmHg/bpm, −0.12 mmHg per ms of upstroke,
  −0.04 mmHg per ms of reflection delay, with a prior SD of 2.5 × each weight.
- **Data:** the 3 calibration rounds plus any cuff checks, cuff noise 4 mmHg. Older points weigh
  less (half-life 14 days, never below 0.25). A point taken long after the base calibration also
  gets extra variance for baseline drift (random walk, 4 mmHg² per day), so drift is not
  mistaken for sensitivity.
- **Baseline:** the reference pressure follows the most recent cuff points (half-life 5 days),
  each moved to the reference features along the fitted slopes.

A feature is used only when every calibration point and the current reading have it.

**Uncertainty** (±, about one SD) combines cuff and model error (5 mmHg), the fit residual, drift
of 0.15 mmHg per day since the latest cuff point, and extrapolation that grows with distance from
the calibration.

**Beyond the calibration:** a core feature (HR, upstroke, width, reflection delay) more than 2.5
typical spreads away, a change of more than 20/14 mmHg, or a pressure outside the cuff range the
calibration has seen (± 20). The reading is shown and flagged. Output is limited to 60–250 /
35–150 mmHg (physiological limits, not a clamp to the calibration).

## Personal learned model on the phone (algorithm 4)

The watch sends every reading's raw pulse wave to the phone. Once there are at least 6 cuff
checks, the phone trains a small **ridge regression on the residual** (cuff − watch estimate)
from an embedding of the pulse wave, with the penalty chosen by leave-one-out (LOO) error and the
bias shrunk towards 0 (`HybridBpModel`). Two embedders compete:

- **Pulse shape** (pure Kotlin): the 32-point ensemble beat, its slope and the timing features.
- **PaPaGei-S** (Nokia Bell Labs, ICLR 2025, BSD-3-Clause): a PPG foundation model pretrained
  on 57,000 h of PPG, exported to ONNX and quantized to int8 (5.7 MB, `tools/bp-ml`), run with
  ONNX Runtime. Its 512-d embedding of two 10 s windows (125 Hz, z-scored) is averaged.

The one with the lower LOO error is used, and **only if it beats the watch's estimate by at least
10 % on this user's own checks**. The correction is limited to ±25 mmHg. A refined reading shows
"Refined by your personal model (watch showed …)". The accuracy card also shows the ± that
covered 80 % of the user's cuff checks (split-conformal), once there are 5.

Why no population BP model: models trained on ICU/surgery finger PPG (PulseDB, VitalDB,
MIMIC) lose much of their accuracy on other people and devices (calibration-free ≈ 14/8.5 mmHg
MAE; calibrated ≈ 9/5.8), and wrist PPG differs. The pretrained network is used only as a
feature extractor; the regression is always personal and gated.

## Pulse arrival time (in validation)

The Galaxy Watch reports a green PPG sample with every ECG sample (`EcgSet.PPG_GREEN`, 500 Hz).
Each ECG recording now computes the median time from the R peak to the wrist pulse's steepest
upstroke (`PulseArrival`) and stores it in the ECG metrics (`pulseArrivalMs`). PAT tracks
systolic changes better than shape alone (with the pre-ejection-period caveat; Mukkamala 2015).
It isn't used in the estimate until device tests confirm the channel carries a full pulse wave
on each model (docs/DEVICE_TESTING.md).

## Honest limits

- Algorithm 5's thresholds (CV 0.15, 25 bpm, perfusion index 0.6, 0.5 bpm/s, 35°) and the rate
  slopes are literature-informed starting points, checked on synthetic scenarios
  (`SyntheticPpg.scenario`, `BpAlgorithm5Test`). They must be confirmed on exported real data
  before they are tightened.
- The perfusion index needs the raw light level; readings without it (older calibrations until
  they are upgraded from their raw PPG) skip the compensatory check.
- The rate-dependent pulse shortening differs between people. It is corrected with population
  slopes, not fitted per user.

- Calibrated cuffless BP devices mainly track the user's **baseline**. They follow slow, moderate
  changes, but are poor at large or fast changes, especially long after calibration
  (Mukkamala et al., *Hypertension* 2022/2023). Readings that stay close to the calibration are
  partly inherent to the method, not always a bug.
- The population sensitivities are literature-informed approximations. They are not fitted on a
  clinical dataset, and the 3-point personal fit can only correct them partly.
- Heartline is a wellness app. BP estimates don't diagnose or rule out hypertension.

## Evaluating changes on real data

Blood pressure → Share → **BP data (JSON)** exports the calibration and every cuff-checked
reading with its raw PPG. `BP_DATASET=file ./gradlew :shared:test --tests '*BpDatasetReport*' -i`
replays the current algorithm (with and without cuff checks) and prints mean difference ± SD,
MAE, % within 10 mmHg and the proportional-bias slope; `tools/bp-ml/evaluate_embedders.py`
compares the learned-model embedders. A change is kept only if it improves these on real data.

## Accuracy check (validation mode)

In **Blood pressure → Accuracy check** on the phone, the user can enter a cuff reading taken right
after (within 30 minutes of) a watch reading. Heartline then shows the watch-minus-cuff mean
difference and spread (Bland–Altman style), and the share of readings within 10 mmHg, as they are.
This is the honest way to judge accuracy for one person. ISO 81060-2 requires a mean difference
of ≤ 5 mmHg with SD ≤ 8 mmHg across many people. Heartline makes no such claim.
