All of them are drawn from the app's own launcher icon
(`phone/src/main/res/drawable/ic_launcher_*.xml`) and the published screenshots, so they stay in
step with the app. After changing the icon or the screenshots:

```bash
HEARTLINE_BRAND_ASSETS=1 ./gradlew :phone:testDebugUnitTest --tests '*BrandAssetsTest*'
python3 tools/screenshots/sync.py   # optimises the PNGs
```

The layouts are in `phone/src/test/kotlin/com/heartline/phone/BrandAssetsTest.kt`.

The Heartline name and icon are not covered by the AGPL license. Forks use their own name and icon;
see the [trademark policy](../../TRADEMARK.md).
