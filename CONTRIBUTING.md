# Contributing to Heartline

Thanks for helping! Heartline is free software under the [AGPL-3.0](LICENSE). **Improvements
belong in the official app.** Please send them as pull requests to
[selin2005/heartline](https://github.com/selin2005/heartline) instead of publishing a separate
version, so every user benefits.

## Before you start
- **Questions and ideas:** talk to us in the [Heartline community on Telegram](https://t.me/HeartlineCommunity).
- **Bugs:** open an issue using the *Bug report* form. It asks for the app versions (phone and
  watch), the watch model with its One UI Watch and Health Platform versions, and the phone
  model with its One UI / Android version.
- **Tested a new device?** Fill in the *Device report* form; it goes into
  [docs/TESTED_DEVICES.md](docs/TESTED_DEVICES.md).
- **Features:** open a *Feature request* issue first, so we can agree on the approach before you
  write code.
- **Security problems:** don't open an issue. Follow [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).
- Never attach real health data, ECG exports or logs that contain personal information.

## Contributor License Agreement
All contributors must sign the [CLA](CLA.md) once. The CLA Assistant bot will ask you on your first
pull request. You just reply with the sentence it gives you. The CLA lets the maintainer ship
Heartline on app stores and keep the license manageable. You keep the copyright in your work.

## Development setup
Requirements: JDK 21 and the Android SDK (compile SDK 37). No device is needed for most work.

```bash
./gradlew :phone:assembleDebug :wear:assembleDebug  # debug APKs
./gradlew test                                    # JVM, Robolectric and Paparazzi tests
./gradlew ktlintCheck                             # lint (ktlintFormat fixes most issues)
./gradlew recordPaparazziDebug                    # re-record screenshots after a UI change
python3 tools/screenshots/sync.py                 # copy screenshots into docs/screenshots
python3 tools/ci/license-headers.py --fix         # add license headers to new files
```

To try the watch UI without the Samsung sensors, build it with fake sensors:
`./gradlew -Pheartline.fakeSensors=true :wear:assembleGithubDebug`. Device testing is described in
[docs/DEVICE_TESTING.md](docs/DEVICE_TESTING.md).

## Pull requests
1. Fork the repository and create a branch from `main`.
2. Keep each pull request focused on one change. Match the style of the surrounding code.
3. Add or update tests. For UI changes, re-record the Paparazzi screenshots and run
   `tools/screenshots/sync.py`.
4. Make sure `./gradlew ktlintCheck test` passes.
5. Every new source file starts with the SPDX header (`tools/ci/license-headers.py --fix`).
6. Write user-facing text in plain English and keep the wellness wording: Heartline never
   diagnoses. Avoid words like "diagnose", "detects disease" or "medical-grade".
7. Describe what changed and why, and link the issue.
8. Commit under your own name. Leave out AI attribution lines (`Co-Authored-By` an AI tool,
   session links); CI checks this (`tools/ci/check-commits.py`).

The fork is only a way to prepare your pull request. Please read [TRADEMARK.md](TRADEMARK.md)
before distributing a modified build: it has to use a different name, icon and application ID.
